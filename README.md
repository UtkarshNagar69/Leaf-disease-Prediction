#Leaf Disease Prediction using Machine Learning in CNN

#Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to help farmers and agriculturists identify plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop losses.

#Features

Image-based leaf disease detection

Classification of multiple plant diseases

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high-accuracy predictions

User-friendly implementation with Python and TensorFlow/Keras

#Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of leaf images with various diseases. The dataset consists of labeled images covering multiple plant species and disease types.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

NumPy & Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

#Usage

Prepare the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py

Train the CNN model:

python train.py

Evaluate and test the model:

python evaluate.py

Run the prediction script with an image:

python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg

#Model Architecture

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling and fully connected layers for classification. Techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning can be applied for improved accuracy.
