# 🌿 Leaf Disease Prediction using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying leaf diseases using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The goal is to help farmers and agriculturists **identify plant diseases early**, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop losses.

---

## ✨ Features
✅ **Image-based** leaf disease detection  
✅ **Multi-class classification** for various plant diseases  
✅ **High-accuracy** predictions with CNN  
✅ **User-friendly implementation** using Python & TensorFlow/Keras  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a **diverse dataset** of leaf images with various diseases. It consists of **labeled images** covering multiple plant species and disease types. Open-source datasets, including **Kaggle datasets**, have been utilized.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🤖 **TensorFlow/Keras**
- 📸 **OpenCV** (for image preprocessing)
- 🔢 **NumPy & Pandas**
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Prepare the dataset
Place the dataset in the **`data/`** directory.

### 2️⃣ Run the preprocessing script
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 3️⃣ Train the CNN model
```bash
python train.py
```

### 4️⃣ Evaluate and test the model
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### 5️⃣ Run predictions on an image
```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
